This is how the app looks when you open it. To change the default city, I will discuss it later.

When you click on the search icon on the top right corner, you will enter a new page. It should look like this.

![Search City](https://github.com/Volpone24/Weather-App-using-Flutter/blob/master/images/Capture2.JPG)

After you enter the city, you will pop out from the current page nad see the update weather of the city.
